# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview
This project involved using Plotly, JavaScript, and HTML to dynamically visualize data about belly button bacteria to find "the next great taste" and display the visualizations on a public webpage. The webpage can be accessed here: https://borkard.github.io/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/

## Results
The webpage contains a dropdown option to choose a Test Subject ID Number and, once an ID number is selected, the following information and visualizations will appear below: 

* The demographic information of the test subject

* Bar chart of the Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found
